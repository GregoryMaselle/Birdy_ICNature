## Abstract

Intaka Island nature reserve is an award-winning wetlands and bird sanctuary (https://intaka.co.za/) in
Century City. There are hardly any signposts nor information about which bird species a visitor is looking
at. Birdy aims to enhance the educational experience at Intaka Island by providing a dynamic and easy-to-
use resource to access resident bird information.
This resource will have 3 main tools to enhance the visitor’s experience. Firstly, a search tool is provided
to enable the user to learn more about a particular bird by searching for it by name. Secondly, the
application provides a tool which helps the user to identify a bird they are viewing by describing it using 5
prechosen features of the bird. Thirdly, the application allows users to record where and when they have
spotted resident birds.
Unit, integration, stress and performance tests were performed to evaluate the robustness and reliability of
the application. User acceptance tests were conducted to confirm that the application meets user’s
requirements and to evaluate the usefulness of the application. From the results of these tests, we can
conclude that Birdy is an effective easy-to-use tool that would enhance a visitor’s educational experience
at Intaka Island.

## Introduction

Intaka Island is a 16-hectare nature reserve which houses 177 species of plants and 120 different bird
species. While it is a beautiful nature reserve, it does not provide sufficient resources for visitors to learn
about the birds that they are looking at, nor does it display sufficient information to help visitors identify
birds. The scope of this project was to create an Android application that solves this issue by providing
users with a means of identifying any bird they may be looking at and displaying information for the user
to learn about the bird. Although this reserve has a plethora of different plants and birds, we agreed with
our client that we would specialise our application specifically towards birds to better fulfill users’
requirements. Firstly, users may identify birds through two mediums: a search bar and a screen where they
describe the bird’s appearance to yield results of which bird it may be. Secondly, upon identifying the
bird, the user is taken to a screen which displays some features of the bird as well as a short description of
it. The primary goal of the application is to ensure that visitors of Intaka Island leave having learnt
something during their visit. Additionally, the application aims to make a visit to the reserve more
engaging for users. In completing this project, we used a hybrid project management model. Initially, we
employed an analysis and requirements specification phase similar to that of the waterfall method. This
phase entailed three meetings with the client to understand clearly what her requirements for the
application were, before proceeding with designing and implementing it. Once the requirements
specification was complete, we employed a model more similar to agile with iterative development and
testing phases. This hybrid model was best suited to our needs and aided us in timeously and effectively
developing the application as required.

## Development

This application is a mobile application and was developed in Android Studio in the language Kotlin.
Some other tools that were used in this applications development was Selenium (for image collection)
as well as Wikipedia API.
